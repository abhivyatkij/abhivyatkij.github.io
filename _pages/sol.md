## Important Points

- A participant may also register at the nearest center on the exam day as a "walk-in" applicant by sharing the registration details and paying the fees equivalent to the standard registration fees for that year.
- Once the registration is done, a tentative list of students and their roll numbers will be posted on this website. Keep checking this website for further updates!
